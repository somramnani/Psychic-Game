# Psychic-Game

A game where  the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

### What Is Used
HTML,CSS & JavaScript
Bootstrap is also used for styling. 

### Game Features 
- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

- When the player wins, the Wins counter increases  and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

- When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
